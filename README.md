## Description

This Project figures out what the fox truly says. It takes in input from the user that is recording sounds in a forest. It asks the user how many recordings the user has and accepts and stores the integer. It then proceeds to store the recordings and compare it to sounds that the user knows already. The end result outputs the rest of the noises that the user does not know, which should be what the fox says.
